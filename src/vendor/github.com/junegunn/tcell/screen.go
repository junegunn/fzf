	// GetContent returns the contents at the given location.  If the
	// coordinates are out of range, then the values will be 0, nil,
	// StyleDefault.  Note that the contents returned are logical contents
	// and may not actually be what is displayed, but rather are what will
	// be displayed if Show() or Sync() is called.  The width is the width
	// in screen cells; most often this will be 1, but some East Asian
	// characters require two cells.
	GetContent(x, y int) (mainc rune, combc []rune, style Style, width int)

	// SetContent sets the contents of the given cell location.  If
	// the coordinates are out of range, then the operation is ignored.

	// The first rune is the primary non-zero width rune.  The array
	// that follows is a possible list of combining characters to append,
	// and will usually be nil (no combining characters.)
	//
	// The results are not displayd until Show() or Sync() is called.
	//
	// Note that wide (East Asian full width) runes occupy two cells,
	// and attempts to place character at next cell to the right will have
	// undefined effects.  Wide runes that are printed in the
	// last column will be replaced with a single width space on output.
	SetContent(x int, y int, mainc rune, combc []rune, style Style)

	// PollEvent waits for events to arrive.  Main application loops

	PollEvent() Event

	// PostEvent tries to post an event into the event stream.  This
	// can fail if the event queue is full.  In that case, the event
	// is dropped, and ErrEventQFull is returned.
	PostEvent(ev Event) error

	// PostEventWait is like PostEvent, but if the queue is full, it
	// blocks until there is space in the queue, making delivery
	// reliable.  However, it is VERY important that this function
	// never be called from within whatever event loop is polling
	// with PollEvent(), otherwise a deadlock may arise.
	//
	// For this reason, when using this function, the use of a
	// Goroutine is recommended to ensure no deadlock can occur.

	// manner possible.
	Show()

	// Sync works like Show(), but it updates every visible cell on the
	// physical display, assuming that it is not synchronized with any
	// internal model.  This may be both expensive and visually jarring,
	// so it should only be used when believed to actually be necessary.
	//
	// Typically this is called as a result of a user-requested redraw
	// (e.g. to clear up on screen corruption caused by some other program),
	// or during a resize event.

	// CharacterSet returns information about the character set.
	// This isn't the full locale, but it does give us the input/output

	// what the user's environment is.
	CharacterSet() string

	// RegisterRuneFallback adds a fallback for runes that are not
	// part of the character set -- for example one coudld register
	// o as a fallback for Ã¸.  This should be done cautiously for
	// characters that might be displayed ordinarily in language
	// specific text -- characters that could change the meaning of
	// of written text would be dangerous.  The intention here is to
	// facilitate fallback characters in pseudo-graphical applications.
	//
	// If the terminal has fallbacks already in place via an alternate
	// character set, those are used in preference.  Also, standard
	// fallbacks for graphical characters in the ACSC terminfo string
	// are registered implicitly.

	// The display string should be the same width as original rune.
	// This makes it possible to register two character replacements
	// for full width East Asian characters, for example.
	//
	// It is recommended that replacement strings consist only of
	// 7-bit ASCII, since other characters may not display everywhere.
	RegisterRuneFallback(r rune, subst string)

	// UnregisterRuneFallback unmaps a replacement.  It will unmap
	// the implicit ASCII replacements for alternate characters as well.
	// When an unmapped char needs to be displayed, but no suitable
	// glyph is available, '?' is emitted instead.  It is not possible
	// to "disable" the use of alternate characters that are supported
	// by your terminal except by changing the terminal database.
	UnregisterRuneFallback(r rune)

	// CanDisplay returns true if the given rune can be displayed on
	// this screen.  Note that this is a best guess effort -- whether
	// your fonts support the character or not may be questionable.
	// Mostly this is for folks who work outside of Unicode.
	//
	// If checkFallbacks is true, then if any (possibly imperfect)
	// fallbacks are registered, this will return true.  This will
	// also return true if the terminal can replace the glyph with
	// one that is visually indistinguishable from the one requested.
	CanDisplay(r rune, checkFallbacks bool) bool

	// that hijack certain keys).  Its best not to depend to strictly
