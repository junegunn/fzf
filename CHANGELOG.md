CHANGELOG
=========

0.44.1
------
- Fixed crash when preview window is hidden on `focus` event

0.44.0
------
- (Experimental) Sixel image support in preview window (not available on Windows)
    - [bin/fzf-preview.sh](bin/fzf-preview.sh) is added to demonstrate how to
      display an image using Kitty image protocol or Sixel. You can use it
      like so:
      ```sh
      fzf --preview='fzf-preview.sh {}'
      ```
- (Experimental) iTerm2 inline image protocol support in preview window (not available on Windows)
  ```sh
  # Using https://iterm2.com/utilities/imgcat
  fzf --preview 'imgcat -W $FZF_PREVIEW_COLUMNS -H $FZF_PREVIEW_LINES {}'
  ```
- HTTP server can be configured to accept remote connections
  ```sh
  # FZF_API_KEY is required for a non-localhost listen address
  export FZF_API_KEY="$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64)"
  fzf --listen 0.0.0.0:6266
  ```
    - To allow remote process execution, use `--listen-unsafe` instead
      (`execute*`, `reload*`, `become`, `preview`, `change-preview`, `transform-*`)
      ```sh
      fzf --listen-unsafe 0.0.0.0:6266
      ```
- Bug fixes

0.43.0
------
- (Experimental) Added support for Kitty image protocol in the preview window
  (not available on Windows)
  ```sh
  fzf --preview='
    if file --mime-type {} | grep -qF image/; then
      # --transfer-mode=memory is the fastest option but if you want fzf to be able
      # to redraw the image on terminal resize or on 'change-preview-window',
      # you need to use --transfer-mode=stream.
      kitty icat --clear --transfer-mode=memory --stdin=no --place=${FZF_PREVIEW_COLUMNS}x${FZF_PREVIEW_LINES}@0x0 {} | sed \$d
    else
      bat --color=always {}
    fi
  '
  ```
- (Experimental) `--listen` server can report program state in JSON format (`GET /`)
  ```sh
  # fzf server started in "headless" mode
  fzf --listen 6266 2> /dev/null

  # Get program state
  curl localhost:6266 | jq .

  # Increase the number of items returned (default: 100)
  curl localhost:6266?limit=1000 | jq .
  ```
- `--listen` server can be secured by setting `$FZF_API_KEY` environment
  variable.
  ```sh
  export FZF_API_KEY="$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64)"

  # Server
  fzf --listen 6266

  # Client
  curl localhost:6266 -H "x-api-key: $FZF_API_KEY" -d 'change-query(yo)'
  ```
- Added `toggle-header` action
- Added mouse events for `--bind`
    - `scroll-up` (bound to `up`)
    - `scroll-down` (bound to `down`)
    - `shift-scroll-up` (bound to `toggle+up`)
    - `shift-scroll-down` (bound to `toggle+down`)
    - `shift-left-click` (bound to `toggle`)
    - `shift-right-click` (bound to `toggle`)
    - `preview-scroll-up` (bound to `preview-up`)
    - `preview-scroll-down` (bound to `preview-down`)
    ```sh
    # Twice faster scrolling both in the main window and the preview window
    fzf --bind 'scroll-up:up+up,scroll-down:down+down' \
        --bind 'preview-scroll-up:preview-up+preview-up' \
        --bind 'preview-scroll-down:preview-down+preview-down' \
        --preview 'cat {}'
    ```
- Added `offset-up` and `offset-down` actions
  ```sh
  # Scrolling will behave similarly to CTRL-E and CTRL-Y of vim
  fzf --bind scroll-up:offset-up,scroll-down:offset-down \
      --bind ctrl-y:offset-up,ctrl-e:offset-down \
      --scroll-off=5
  ```
- Shell extensions
    - Updated bash completion for fzf options
    - bash key bindings no longer requires perl; it will use awk or mawk
      instead if perl is not found
    - Basic context-aware completion for ssh command
    - Applied `--scheme=path` for better ordering of the result
- Bug fixes and improvements

0.42.0
------
- Added new info style: `--info=right`
- Added new info style: `--info=inline-right`
- Added new border style `thinblock` which uses symbols for legacy computing
  [one eighth block elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbols_for_Legacy_Computing)
    - Similarly to `block`, this style is suitable when using a different
      background color because the window is completely contained within the border.
      ```sh
      BAT_THEME=GitHub fzf --info=right --border=thinblock --preview-window=border-thinblock \
          --margin=3 --scrollbar=▏▕ --preview='bat --color=always --style=numbers {}' \
          --color=light,query:238,fg:238,bg:251,bg+:249,gutter:251,border:248,preview-bg:253
      ```
    - This style may not render correctly depending on the font and the
      terminal emulator.

0.41.1
------
- Fixed a bug where preview window is not updated when `--disabled` is set and
  a reload is triggered by `change:reload` binding

0.41.0
------
- Added color name `preview-border` and `preview-scrollbar`
- Added new border style `block` which uses [block elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements)
- `--scrollbar` can take two characters, one for the main window, the other
  for the preview window
- Putting it altogether:
  ```sh
  fzf-tmux -p 80% --padding 1,2 --preview 'bat --style=plain --color=always {}' \
      --color 'bg:237,bg+:235,gutter:237,border:238,scrollbar:236' \
      --color 'preview-bg:235,preview-border:236,preview-scrollbar:234' \
      --preview-window 'border-block' --border block --scrollbar '▌▐'
  ```
- Bug fixes and improvements

0.40.0
------
- Added `zero` event that is triggered when there's no match
  ```sh
  # Reload the candidate list when there's no match
  echo $RANDOM | fzf --bind 'zero:reload(echo $RANDOM)+clear-query' --height 3
  ```
- New actions
    - Added `track` action which makes fzf track the current item when the
      search result is updated. If the user manually moves the cursor, or the
      item is not in the updated search result, tracking is automatically
      disabled. Tracking is useful when you want to see the surrounding items
      by deleting the query string.
      ```sh
      # Narrow down the list with a query, point to a command,
      # and hit CTRL-T to see its surrounding commands.
      export FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS="
        --preview 'echo {}' --preview-window up:3:hidden:wrap
        --bind 'ctrl-/:toggle-preview'
        --bind 'ctrl-t:track+clear-query'
        --bind 'ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo -n {2..} | pbcopy)+abort'
        --color header:italic
        --header 'Press CTRL-Y to copy command into clipboard'"
      ```
    - Added `change-header(...)`
    - Added `transform-header(...)`
    - Added `toggle-track` action
- Fixed `--track` behavior when used with `--tac`
    - However, using `--track` with `--tac` is not recommended. The resulting
      behavior can be very confusing.
- Bug fixes and improvements

0.39.0
------
- Added `one` event that is triggered when there's only one match
  ```sh
  # Automatically select the only match
  seq 10 | fzf --bind one:accept
  ```
- Added `--track` option that makes fzf track the current selection when the
  result list is updated. This can be useful when browsing logs using fzf with
  sorting disabled.
  ```sh
  git log --oneline --graph --color=always | nl |
      fzf --ansi --track --no-sort --layout=reverse-list
  ```
- If you use `--listen` option without a port number fzf will automatically
  allocate an available port and export it as `$FZF_PORT` environment
  variable.
  ```sh
  # Automatic port assignment
  fzf --listen --bind 'start:execute-silent:echo $FZF_PORT > /tmp/fzf-port'

  # Say hello
  curl "localhost:$(cat /tmp/fzf-port)" -d 'preview:echo Hello, fzf is listening on $FZF_PORT.'
  ```
- A carriage return and a line feed character will be rendered as dim ␍ and
  ␊ respectively.
  ```sh
  printf "foo\rbar\nbaz" | fzf --read0 --preview 'echo {}'
  ```
- fzf will stop rendering a non-displayable characters as a space. This will
  likely cause less glitches in the preview window.
  ```sh
  fzf --preview 'head -1000 /dev/random'
  ```
- Bug fixes and improvements

0.38.0
------
- New actions
    - `become(...)` - Replace the current fzf process with the specified
      command using `execve(2)` system call.
      See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#turning-into-a-different-process for
      more information.
      ```sh
      # Open selected files in Vim
      fzf --multi --bind 'enter:become(vim {+})'

      # Open the file in Vim and go to the line
      git grep --line-number . |
          fzf --delimiter : --nth 3.. --bind 'enter:become(vim {1} +{2})'
      ```
        - This action is not supported on Windows
    - `show-preview`
    - `hide-preview`
- Bug fixes
    - `--preview-window 0,hidden` should not execute the preview command until
      `toggle-preview` action is triggered

0.37.0
------
- Added a way to customize the separator of inline info
  ```sh
  fzf --info 'inline: ╱ ' --prompt '╱ ' --color prompt:bright-yellow
  ```
- New event
    - `focus` - Triggered when the focus changes due to a vertical cursor
      movement or a search result update
      ```sh
      fzf --bind 'focus:transform-preview-label:echo [ {} ]' --preview 'cat {}'

      # Any action bound to the event runs synchronously and thus can make the interface sluggish
      # e.g. lolcat isn't one of the fastest programs, and every cursor movement in
      #      fzf will be noticeably affected by its execution time
      fzf --bind 'focus:transform-preview-label:echo [ {} ] | lolcat -f' --preview 'cat {}'

      # Beware not to introduce an infinite loop
      seq 10 | fzf --bind 'focus:up' --cycle
      ```
- New actions
    - `change-border-label`
    - `change-preview-label`
    - `transform-border-label`
    - `transform-preview-label`
- Bug fixes and improvements

0.36.0
------
- Added `--listen=HTTP_PORT` option to start HTTP server. It allows external
  processes to send actions to perform via POST method.
  ```sh
  # Start HTTP server on port 6266
  fzf --listen 6266

  # Send actions to the server
  curl -XPOST localhost:6266 -d 'reload(seq 100)+change-prompt(hundred> )'
  ```
- Added draggable scrollbar to the main search window and the preview window
  ```sh
  # Hide scrollbar
  fzf --no-scrollbar

  # Customize scrollbar
  fzf --scrollbar ┆ --color scrollbar:blue
  ```
- New event
    - Added `load` event that is triggered when the input stream is complete
      and the initial processing of the list is complete.
      ```sh
      # Change the prompt to "loaded" when the input stream is complete
      (seq 10; sleep 1; seq 11 20) | fzf --prompt 'Loading> ' --bind 'load:change-prompt:Loaded> '

      # You can use it instead of 'start' event without `--sync` if asynchronous
      # trigger is not an issue.
      (seq 10; sleep 1; seq 11 20) | fzf --bind 'load:last'
      ```
- New actions
    - Added `pos(...)` action to move the cursor to the numeric position
        - `first` and `last` are equivalent to `pos(1)` and `pos(-1)` respectively
      ```sh
      # Put the cursor on the 10th item
      seq 100 | fzf --sync --bind 'start:pos(10)'

      # Put the cursor on the 10th to last item
      seq 100 | fzf --sync --bind 'start:pos(-10)'
      ```
    - Added `reload-sync(...)` action which replaces the current list only after
      the reload process is complete. This is useful when the command takes
      a while to produce the initial output and you don't want fzf to run against
      an empty list while the command is running.
      ```sh
      # You can still filter and select entries from the initial list for 3 seconds
      seq 100 | fzf --bind 'load:reload-sync(sleep 3; seq 1000)+unbind(load)'
      ```
    - Added `next-selected` and `prev-selected` actions to move between selected
      items
      ```sh
      # `next-selected` will move the pointer to the next selected item below the current line
      # `prev-selected` will move the pointer to the previous selected item above the current line
      seq 10 | fzf --multi --bind ctrl-n:next-selected,ctrl-p:prev-selected

      # Both actions respect --layout option
      seq 10 | fzf --multi --bind ctrl-n:next-selected,ctrl-p:prev-selected --layout reverse
      ```
    - Added `change-query(...)` action that simply changes the query string to the
      given static string. This can be useful when used with `--listen`.
      ```sh
      curl localhost:6266 -d "change-query:$(date)"
      ```
    - Added `transform-prompt(...)` action for transforming the prompt string
      using an external command
      ```sh
      # Press space to change the prompt string using an external command
      # (only the first line of the output is taken)
      fzf --bind 'space:reload(ls),load:transform-prompt(printf "%s> " "$(date)")'
      ```
    - Added `transform-query(...)` action for transforming the query string using
      an external command
      ```sh
      # Press space to convert the query to uppercase letters
      fzf --bind 'space:transform-query(tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]" <<< {q})'

      # Bind it to 'change' event for automatic conversion
      fzf --bind 'change:transform-query(tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]" <<< {q})'

      # Can only type numbers
      fzf --bind 'change:transform-query(sed "s/[^0-9]//g" <<< {q})'
      ```
    - `put` action can optionally take an argument string
      ```sh
      # a will put 'alpha' on the prompt, ctrl-b will put 'bravo'
      fzf --bind 'a:put+put(lpha),ctrl-b:put(bravo)'
      ```
- Added color name `preview-label` for `--preview-label` (defaults to `label`
  for `--border-label`)
- Better support for (Windows) terminals where each box-drawing character
  takes 2 columns. Set `RUNEWIDTH_EASTASIAN` environment variable to `0` or `1`.
    - On Vim, the variable will be automatically set if `&ambiwidth` is `double`
- Behavior changes
    - fzf will always execute the preview command if the command template
      contains `{q}` even when it's empty. If you prefer the old behavior,
      you'll have to check if `{q}` is empty in your command.
      ```sh
      # This will show // even when the query is empty
      : | fzf --preview 'echo /{q}/'

      # But if you don't want it,
      : | fzf --preview '[ -n {q} ] || exit; echo /{q}/'
      ```
    - `double-click` will behave the same as `enter` unless otherwise specified,
      so you don't have to repeat the same action twice in `--bind` in most cases.
      ```sh
      # No need to bind 'double-click' to the same action
      fzf --bind 'enter:execute:less {}' # --bind 'double-click:execute:less {}'
      ```
    - If the color for `separator` is not specified, it will default to the
      color for `border`. Same holds true for `scrollbar`. This is to reduce
      the number of configuration items required to achieve a consistent color
      scheme.
    - If `follow` flag is specified in `--preview-window` option, fzf will
      automatically scroll to the bottom of the streaming preview output. But
      when the user manually scrolls the window, the following stops. With
      this version, fzf will resume following if the user scrolls the window
      to the bottom.
    - Default border style on Windows is changed to `sharp` because some
      Windows terminals are not capable of displaying `rounded` border
      characters correctly.
- Minor bug fixes and improvements

0.35.1
------
- Fixed a bug where fzf with `--tiebreak=chunk` crashes on inverse match query
- Fixed a bug where clicking above fzf would paste escape sequences

0.35.0
------
- Added `start` event that is triggered only once when fzf finder starts.
  Since fzf consumes the input stream asynchronously, the input list is not
  available unless you use `--sync`.
  ```sh
  seq 100 | fzf --multi --sync --bind 'start:last+select-all+preview(echo welcome)'
  ```
- Added `--border-label` and `--border-label-pos` for putting label on the border
  ```sh
  # ANSI color codes are supported
  # (with https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat)
  label=$(curl -s http://metaphorpsum.com/sentences/1 | lolcat -f)

  # Border label at the center
  fzf --height=10 --border --border-label="╢ $label ╟" --color=label:italic:black

  # Left-aligned (positive integer)
  fzf --height=10 --border --border-label="╢ $label ╟" --border-label-pos=3 --color=label:italic:black

  # Right-aligned (negative integer) on the bottom line (:bottom)
  fzf --height=10 --border --border-label="╢ $label ╟" --border-label-pos=-3:bottom --color=label:italic:black
  ```
- Also added `--preview-label` and `--preview-label-pos` for the border of the
  preview window
  ```sh
  fzf --preview 'cat {}' --border --preview-label=' Preview ' --preview-label-pos=2
  ```
- Info panel (match counter) will be followed by a horizontal separator by
  default
    - Use `--no-separator` or `--separator=''` to hide the separator
    - You can specify an arbitrary string that is repeated to form the
      horizontal separator. e.g. `--separator=╸`
    - The color of the separator can be customized via `--color=separator:...`
    - ANSI color codes are also supported
  ```sh
  fzf --separator=╸ --color=separator:green
  fzf --separator=$(lolcat -f -F 1.4 <<< ▁▁▂▃▄▅▆▆▅▄▃▂▁▁) --info=inline
  ```
- Added `--border=bold` and `--border=double` along with
  `--preview-window=border-bold` and `--preview-window=border-double`

0.34.0
------
- Added support for adaptive `--height`. If the `--height` value is prefixed
  with `~`, fzf will automatically determine the height in the range according
  to the input size.
  ```sh
  seq 1 | fzf --height ~70% --border --padding 1 --margin 1
  seq 10 | fzf --height ~70% --border --padding 1 --margin 1
  seq 100 | fzf --height ~70% --border --padding 1 --margin 1
  ```
    - There are a few limitations
        - Not compatible with percent top/bottom margin/padding
          ```sh
          # This is not allowed (top/bottom margin in percent value)
          fzf --height ~50% --border --margin 5%,10%

          # This is allowed (top/bottom margin in fixed value)
          fzf --height ~50% --border --margin 2,10%
          ```
        - fzf will not start until it can determine the right height for the input
          ```sh
          # fzf will open immediately
          (sleep 2; seq 10) | fzf --height 50%

          # fzf will open after 2 seconds
          (sleep 2; seq 10) | fzf --height ~50%
          (sleep 2; seq 1000) | fzf --height ~50%
          ```
- Fixed tcell renderer used to render full-screen fzf on Windows
- ~~`--no-clear` is deprecated. Use `reload` action instead.~~

0.33.0
------
- Added `--scheme=[default|path|history]` option to choose scoring scheme
    - (Experimental)
    - We updated the scoring algorithm in 0.32.0, however we have learned that
      this new scheme (`default`) is not always giving the optimal result
    - `path`: Additional bonus point is only given to the characters after
      path separator. You might want to choose this scheme if you have many
      files with spaces in their paths.
    - `history`: No additional bonus points are given so that we give more
      weight to the chronological ordering. This is equivalent to the scoring
      scheme before 0.32.0. This also sets `--tiebreak=index`.
- ANSI color sequences with colon delimiters are now supported.
  ```sh
  printf "\e[38;5;208mOption 1\e[m\nOption 2" | fzf --ansi
  printf "\e[38:5:208mOption 1\e[m\nOption 2" | fzf --ansi
  ```
- Support `border-{up,down}` as the synonyms for `border-{top,bottom}` in
  `--preview-window`
- Added support for ANSI `strikethrough`
  ```sh
  printf "\e[9mdeleted" | fzf --ansi
  fzf --color fg+:strikethrough
  ```

0.32.1
------
- Fixed incorrect ordering of `--tiebreak=chunk`
- fzf-tmux will show fzf border instead of tmux popup border (requires tmux 3.3)
  ```sh
  fzf-tmux -p70%
  fzf-tmux -p70% --color=border:bright-red
  fzf-tmux -p100%,60% --color=border:bright-yellow --border=horizontal --padding 1,5 --margin 1,0
  fzf-tmux -p70%,100% --color=border:bright-green --border=vertical

  # Key bindings (CTRL-T, CTRL-R, ALT-C) will use these options
  export FZF_TMUX_OPTS='-p100%,60% --color=border:green --border=horizontal --padding 1,5 --margin 1,0'
  ```

0.32.0
------
- Updated the scoring algorithm
    - Different bonus points to different categories of word boundaries
      (listed higher to lower bonus point)
        - Word after whitespace characters or beginning of the string
        - Word after common delimiter characters (`/,:;|`)
        - Word after other non-word characters
      ```sh
      # foo/bar.sh` is preferred over `foo-bar.sh` on `bar`
      fzf --query=bar --height=4 << EOF
      foo-bar.sh
      foo/bar.sh
      EOF
      ```
- Added a new tiebreak `chunk`
    - Favors the line with shorter matched chunk. A chunk is a set of
      consecutive non-whitespace characters.
    - Unlike the default `length`, this scheme works well with tabular input
      ```sh
      # length prefers item #1, because the whole line is shorter,
      # chunk prefers item #2, because the matched chunk ("foo") is shorter
      fzf --height=6 --header-lines=2 --tiebreak=chunk --reverse --query=fo << "EOF"
      N | Field1 | Field2 | Field3
      - | ------ | ------ | ------
      1 | hello  | foobar | baz
      2 | world  | foo    | bazbaz
      EOF
      ```
    - If the input does not contain any spaces, `chunk` is equivalent to
      `length`. But we're not going to set it as the default because it is
      computationally more expensive.
- Bug fixes and improvements

0.31.0
------
- Added support for an alternative preview window layout that is activated
  when the size of the preview window is smaller than a certain threshold.
  ```sh
  # If the width of the preview window is smaller than 50 columns,
  # it will be displayed above the search window.
  fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window 'right,50%,border-left,<50(up,30%,border-bottom)'

  # Or you can just hide it like so
  fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window '<50(hidden)'
  ```
- fzf now uses SGR mouse mode to properly support mouse on larger terminals
- You can now use characters that do not satisfy `unicode.IsGraphic` constraint
  for `--marker`, `--pointer`, and `--ellipsis`. Allows Nerd Fonts and stuff.
  Use at your own risk.
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Shell extension
    - `kill` completion now requires trigger sequence (`**`) for consistency

0.30.0
------
- Fixed cursor flickering over the screen by hiding it during rendering
- Added `--ellipsis` option. You can take advantage of it to make fzf
  effectively search non-visible parts of the item.
  ```sh
  # Search against hidden line numbers on the far right
  nl /usr/share/dict/words                  |
    awk '{printf "%s%1000s\n", $2, $1}'     |
    fzf --nth=-1 --no-hscroll --ellipsis='' |
    awk '{print $2}'
  ```
- Added `rebind` action for restoring bindings after `unbind`
- Bug fixes and improvements

0.29.0
------
- Added `change-preview(...)` action to change the `--preview` command
    - cf. `preview(...)` is a one-off action that doesn't change the default
      preview command
- Added `change-preview-window(...)` action
    - You can rotate through the different options separated by `|`
      ```sh
      fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window right:40% \
          --bind 'ctrl-/:change-preview-window(right,70%|down,40%,border-top|hidden|)'
      ```
- Fixed rendering of the prompt line when overflow occurs with `--info=inline`

0.28.0
------
- Added `--header-first` option to print header before the prompt line
  ```sh
  fzf --header $'Welcome to fzf\n▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔' --reverse --height 30% --border --header-first
  ```
- Added `--scroll-off=LINES` option (similar to `scrolloff` option of Vim)
    - You can set it to a very large number so that the cursor stays in the
      middle of the screen while scrolling
      ```sh
      fzf --scroll-off=5
      fzf --scroll-off=999
      ```
- Fixed bug where preview window is not updated on `reload` (#2644)
- fzf on Windows will also use `$SHELL` to execute external programs
    - See #2638 and #2647
    - Thanks to @rashil2000, @vovcacik, and @janlazo

0.27.3
------
- Preview window is `hidden` by default when there are `preview` bindings but
  `--preview` command is not given
- Fixed bug where `{n}` is not properly reset on `reload`
- Fixed bug where spinner is not displayed on `reload`
- Enhancements in tcell renderer for Windows (#2616)
- Vim plugin
    - `sinklist` is added as a synonym to `sink*` so that it's easier to add
      a function to a spec dictionary
      ```vim
      let spec = { 'source': 'ls', 'options': ['--multi', '--preview', 'cat {}'] }
      function spec.sinklist(matches)
        echom string(a:matches)
      endfunction

      call fzf#run(fzf#wrap(spec))
      ```
    - Vim 7 compatibility

0.27.2

  fzf --color fg:yellow,fg+:bright-yellow
  ```
- Fix bug where `--read0` not properly displaying long lines

0.27.1
------
- Added `unbind` action. In the following Ripgrep launcher example, you can
  use `unbind(reload)` to switch to fzf-only filtering mode.
    - See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#switching-to-fzf-only-search-mode
- Vim plugin
    - Vim plugin will stop immediately even when the source command hasn't finished
      ```vim
      " fzf will read the stream file while allowing other processes to append to it
      call fzf#run({'source': 'cat /dev/null > /tmp/stream; tail -f /tmp/stream'})
      ```
    - It is now possible to open popup window relative to the current window
      ```vim
      let g:fzf_layout = { 'window': { 'width': 0.9, 'height': 0.6, 'relative': v:true, 'yoffset': 1.0 } }
      ```

0.27.0
------
- More border options for `--preview-window`
  ```sh
  fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window border-left
  fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window border-left --border horizontal
  fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window top:border-bottom
  fzf --preview 'cat {}' --preview-window top:border-horizontal
  ```
- Automatically set `/dev/tty` as STDIN on execute action
  ```sh
  # Redirect /dev/tty to suppress "Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal"
  # ls | fzf --bind "enter:execute(vim {} < /dev/tty)"

  # "< /dev/tty" part is no longer needed
  ls | fzf --bind "enter:execute(vim {})"
  ```
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Signed and notarized macOS binaries
  (Huge thanks to [BACKERS.md](https://github.com/junegunn/junegunn/blob/main/BACKERS.md)!)

0.26.0
------
- Added support for fixed header in preview window
  ```sh
  # Display top 3 lines as the fixed header
  fzf --preview 'bat --style=header,grid --color=always {}' --preview-window '~3'
  ```
- More advanced preview offset expression to better support the fixed header
  ```sh
  # Preview with bat, matching line in the middle of the window below
  # the fixed header of the top 3 lines
  #
  #   ~3    Top 3 lines as the fixed header
  #   +{2}  Base scroll offset extracted from the second field
  #   +3    Extra offset to compensate for the 3-line header
  #   /2    Put in the middle of the preview area
  #
  git grep --line-number '' |
    fzf --delimiter : \
        --preview 'bat --style=full --color=always --highlight-line {2} {1}' \
        --preview-window '~3:+{2}+3/2'
  ```
- Added `select` and `deselect` action for unconditionally selecting or
  deselecting a single item in `--multi` mode. Complements `toggle` action.
- Significant performance improvement in ANSI code processing
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Built with Go 1.16

0.25.1
------
- Added `close` action
    - Close preview window if open, abort fzf otherwise
- Bug fixes and improvements

0.25.0
------
- Text attributes set in `--color` are not reset when fzf sees another
  `--color` option for the same element. This allows you to put custom text
  attributes in your `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` and still have those attributes
  even when you override the colors.

  ```sh
  # Default colors and attributes
  fzf

  # Apply custom text attributes
  export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--color fg+:italic,hl:-1:underline,hl+:-1:reverse:underline'

  fzf

  # Different colors but you still have the attributes
  fzf --color hl:176,hl+:177

  # Write "regular" if you want to clear the attributes
  fzf --color hl:176:regular,hl+:177:regular
  ```
- Renamed `--phony` to `--disabled`
- You can dynamically enable and disable the search functionality using the
  new `enable-search`, `disable-search`, and `toggle-search` actions
- You can assign a different color to the query string for when search is disabled
  ```sh
  fzf --color query:#ffffff,disabled:#999999 --bind space:toggle-search
  ```
- Added `last` action to move the cursor to the last match
    - The opposite action `top` is renamed to `first`, but `top` is still
      recognized as a synonym for backward compatibility
- Added `preview-top` and `preview-bottom` actions
- Extended support for alt key chords: alt with any case-sensitive single character
  ```sh
  fzf --bind alt-,:first,alt-.:last
  ```

0.24.4
------
- Added `--preview-window` option `follow`
  ```sh
  # Preview window will automatically scroll to the bottom
  fzf --preview-window follow --preview 'for i in $(seq 100000); do
    echo "$i"
    sleep 0.01
    (( i % 300 == 0 )) && printf "\033[2J"
  done'
  ```
- Added `change-prompt` action
  ```sh
  fzf --prompt 'foo> ' --bind $'a:change-prompt:\x1b[31mbar> '
  ```
- Bug fixes and improvements

0.24.3
------
- Added `--padding` option
  ```sh
  fzf --margin 5% --padding 5% --border --preview 'cat {}' \
      --color bg:#222222,preview-bg:#333333
  ```

0.24.2
------
- Bug fixes and improvements

0.24.1
------
- Fixed broken `--color=[bw|no]` option

0.24.0
------
- Real-time rendering of preview window
  ```sh
  # fzf can render preview window before the command completes
  fzf --preview 'sleep 1; for i in $(seq 100); do echo $i; sleep 0.01; done'

  # Preview window can process ANSI escape sequence (CSI 2 J) for clearing the display
  fzf --preview 'for i in $(seq 100000); do
    (( i % 200 == 0 )) && printf "\033[2J"
    echo "$i"
    sleep 0.01
  done'
  ```
- Updated `--color` option to support text styles
  - `regular` / `bold` / `dim` / `underline` / `italic` / `reverse` / `blink`
    ```sh
    # * Set -1 to keep the original color
    # * Multiple style attributes can be combined
    # * Italic style may not be supported by some terminals
    rg --line-number --no-heading --color=always "" |
      fzf --ansi --prompt "Rg: " \
          --color fg+:italic,hl:underline:-1,hl+:italic:underline:reverse:-1 \
          --color pointer:reverse,prompt:reverse,input:159 \
          --pointer '  '
    ```
- More `--border` options
  - `vertical`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`
  - Updated Vim plugin to use these new `--border` options
    ```vim
    " Floating popup window in the center of the screen
    let g:fzf_layout = { 'window': { 'width': 0.9, 'height': 0.6 } }

    " Popup with 100% width
    let g:fzf_layout = { 'window': { 'width': 1.0, 'height': 0.5, 'border': 'horizontal' } }

    " Popup with 100% height
    let g:fzf_layout = { 'window': { 'width': 0.5, 'height': 1.0, 'border': 'vertical' } }

    " Similar to 'down' layout, but it uses a popup window and doesn't affect the window layout
    let g:fzf_layout = { 'window': { 'width': 1.0, 'height': 0.5, 'yoffset': 1.0, 'border': 'top' } }

    " Opens on the right;
    "   'highlight' option is still supported but it will only take the foreground color of the group
    let g:fzf_layout = { 'window': { 'width': 0.5, 'height': 1.0, 'xoffset': 1.0, 'border': 'left', 'highlight': 'Comment' } }
    ```
- To indicate if `--multi` mode is enabled, fzf will print the number of
  selected items even when no item is selected
  ```sh
  seq 100 | fzf
    # 100/100
  seq 100 | fzf --multi
    # 100/100 (0)
  seq 100 | fzf --multi 5
    # 100/100 (0/5)
  ```

  git grep --line-number '' |
    fzf --delimiter : \
        --preview 'bat --style=numbers --color=always --highlight-line {2} {1}' \
        --preview-window +{2}-/2
  ```

        - It also downloads the latest binary if it's not available by running
          `./install --bin`
- Built with Go 1.15.2
    - We no longer provide 32-bit binaries

0.22.0
------
- Added more options for `--bind`
    - `backward-eof` event
      ```sh
      # Aborts when you delete backward when the query prompt is already empty
      fzf --bind backward-eof:abort
      ```
    - `refresh-preview` action
      ```sh
      # Rerun preview command when you hit '?'
      fzf --preview 'echo $RANDOM' --bind '?:refresh-preview'
      ```
    - `preview` action
      ```sh
      # Default preview command with an extra preview binding
      fzf --preview 'file {}' --bind '?:preview:cat {}'

      # A preview binding with no default preview command
      # (Preview window is initially empty)
      fzf --bind '?:preview:cat {}'

      # Preview window hidden by default, it appears when you first hit '?'
      fzf --bind '?:preview:cat {}' --preview-window hidden
      ```
- Added preview window option for setting the initial scroll offset
  ```sh
  # Initial scroll offset is set to the line number of each line of
  # git grep output *minus* 5 lines
  git grep --line-number '' |
    fzf --delimiter : --preview 'nl {1}' --preview-window +{2}-5
  ```
- Added support for ANSI colors in `--prompt` string
- Smart match of accented characters
    - An unaccented character in the query string will match both accented and
      unaccented characters, while an accented character will only match
      accented characters. This is similar to how "smart-case" match works.
- Vim plugin
    - `tmux` layout option for using fzf-tmux
      ```vim
      let g:fzf_layout = { 'tmux': '-p90%,60%' }
      ```

        - ```sh
          # 50% width and height
          fzf-tmux -p

          # 80% width and height
          fzf-tmux -p 80%

          # 80% width and 40% height
          fzf-tmux -p 80%,40%
          fzf-tmux -w 80% -h 40%

          # Window position
          fzf-tmux -w 80% -h 40% -x 0 -y 0
          fzf-tmux -w 80% -h 40% -y 1000

          # Write ordinary fzf options after --
          fzf-tmux -p -- --reverse --info=inline --margin 2,4 --border
          ```
        - On macOS, you can build the latest tmux from the source with
          `brew install tmux --HEAD`
- Bug fixes
    - Fixed Windows file traversal not to include directories
    - Fixed ANSI colors with `--keep-right`
    - Fixed _fzf_complete for zsh
- Built with Go 1.14.1

0.21.0
------
- `--height` option is now available on Windows as well (@kelleyma49)
- Added `--pointer` and `--marker` options
- Added `--keep-right` option that keeps the right end of the line visible
  when it's too long

      finder instead of printing horizontal lines above and below it.
      The previous style is available via `--border=horizontal`
    - Unicode spinner
- More keys and actions for `--bind`
- Added PowerShell script for downloading Windows binary
- Vim plugin: Built-in floating windows support
  ```vim
  let g:fzf_layout = { 'window': { 'width': 0.9, 'height': 0.6 } }
  ```
- bash: Various improvements in key bindings (CTRL-T, CTRL-R, ALT-C)
    - CTRL-R will start with the current command-line as the initial query
    - CTRL-R properly supports multi-line commands
- Fuzzy completion API changed
  ```sh
  # Previous: fzf arguments given as a single string argument
  # - This style is still supported, but it's deprecated
  _fzf_complete "--multi --reverse --prompt=\"doge> \"" "$@" < <(
    echo foo
  )

  # New API: multiple fzf arguments before "--"
  # - Easier to write multiple options
  _fzf_complete --multi --reverse --prompt="doge> " -- "$@" < <(
    echo foo
  )
  ```
- Bug fixes and improvements

0.20.0
------
- Customizable preview window color (`preview-fg` and `preview-bg` for `--color`)
  ```sh
  fzf --preview 'cat {}' \
      --color 'fg:#bbccdd,fg+:#ddeeff,bg:#334455,preview-bg:#223344,border:#778899' \
      --border --height 20 --layout reverse --info inline
  ```
- Removed the immediate flicking of the screen on `reload` action.
  ```sh
  : | fzf --bind 'change:reload:seq {q}' --phony
  ```
- Added `clear-query` and `clear-selection` actions for `--bind`
- It is now possible to split a composite bind action over multiple `--bind`
  expressions by prefixing the later ones with `+`.
  ```sh
  fzf --bind 'ctrl-a:up+up'

  # Can be now written as
  fzf --bind 'ctrl-a:up' --bind 'ctrl-a:+up'

  # This is useful when you need to write special execute/reload form (i.e. `execute:...`)
  # to avoid parse errors and add more actions to the same key
  fzf --multi --bind 'ctrl-l:select-all+execute:less {+f}' --bind 'ctrl-l:+deselect-all'
  ```
- Fixed parse error of `--bind` expression where concatenated execute/reload
  action contains `+` character.
  ```sh
  fzf --multi --bind 'ctrl-l:select-all+execute(less {+f})+deselect-all'
  ```
- Fixed bugs of reload action
    - Not triggered when there's no match even when the command doesn't have
      any placeholder expressions
    - Screen not properly cleared when `--header-lines` not filled on reload

0.19.0
------

- Added `--phony` option which completely disables search functionality.
  Useful when you want to use fzf only as a selector interface. See below.
- Added "reload" action for dynamically updating the input list without
  restarting fzf. See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1750 to learn
  more about it.
  ```sh
  # Using fzf as the selector interface for ripgrep
  RG_PREFIX="rg --column --line-number --no-heading --color=always --smart-case "
  INITIAL_QUERY="foo"
  FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND="$RG_PREFIX '$INITIAL_QUERY' || true" \
    fzf --bind "change:reload:$RG_PREFIX {q} || true" \
        --ansi --phony --query "$INITIAL_QUERY"
  ```
- `--multi` now takes an optional integer argument which indicates the maximum
  number of items that can be selected
  ```sh
  seq 100 | fzf --multi 3 --reverse --height 50%
  ```
- If a placeholder expression for `--preview` and `execute` action (and the
  new `reload` action) contains `f` flag, it is replaced to the
  path of a temporary file that holds the evaluated list. This is useful
  when you multi-select a large number of items and the length of the
  evaluated string may exceed [`ARG_MAX`][argmax].
  ```sh
  # Press CTRL-A to select 100K items and see the sum of all the numbers
  seq 100000 | fzf --multi --bind ctrl-a:select-all \
                   --preview "awk '{sum+=\$1} END {print sum}' {+f}"
  ```
- `deselect-all` no longer deselects unmatched items. It is now consistent
  with `select-all` and `toggle-all` in that it only affects matched items.
- Due to the limitation of bash, fuzzy completion is enabled by default for
  a fixed set of commands. A helper function for easily setting up fuzzy
  completion for any command is now provided.
  ```sh
  # usage: _fzf_setup_completion path|dir COMMANDS...
  _fzf_setup_completion path git kubectl
  ```
- Info line style can be changed by `--info=STYLE`
    - `--info=default`
    - `--info=inline` (same as old `--inline-info`)
    - `--info=hidden`
- Preview window border can be disabled by adding `noborder` to
  `--preview-window`.
- When you transform the input with `--with-nth`, the trailing white spaces
  are removed.
- `ctrl-\`, `ctrl-]`, `ctrl-^`, and `ctrl-/` can now be used with `--bind`
- See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/milestone/15?closed=1 for more details

- fzf can now start even when `/dev/tty` is not available by making an
  educated guess.

- Fixed inconsistent tiebreak scores when `--nth` is used
- Proper display of tab characters in `--prompt`
- Fixed not to `--cycle` on page-up/page-down to prevent overshoot
- Git revision in `--version` output

0.16.7
------
- Added support for `ctrl-alt-[a-z]` key chords
- CTRL-Z (SIGSTOP) now works with fzf
- fzf will export `$FZF_PREVIEW_WINDOW` so that the scripts can use it
- Bug fixes and improvements in Vim plugin and shell extensions

0.16.6
------
- Minor bug fixes and improvements
- Added `--no-clear` option for scripting purposes

0.16.5
------
- Minor bug fixes
- Added `toggle-preview-wrap` action
- Built with Go 1.8

0.16.4
------
- Added `--border` option to draw border above and below the finder
- Bug fixes and improvements

0.16.3
------
- Fixed a bug where fzf incorrectly display the lines when straddling tab
  characters are trimmed
- Placeholder expression used in `--preview` and `execute` action can
  optionally take `+` flag to be used with multiple selections
    - e.g. `git log --oneline | fzf --multi --preview 'git show {+1}'`
- Added `execute-silent` action for executing a command silently without
  switching to the alternate screen. This is useful when the process is
  short-lived and you're not interested in its output.
    - e.g. `fzf --bind 'ctrl-y:execute!(echo -n {} | pbcopy)'`
- `ctrl-space` is allowed in `--bind`

0.16.2
------
- Dropped ncurses dependency
- Binaries for freebsd, openbsd, arm5, arm6, arm7, and arm8
- Official 24-bit color support
- Added support for composite actions in `--bind`. Multiple actions can be
  chained using `+` separator.
    - e.g. `fzf --bind 'ctrl-y:execute(echo -n {} | pbcopy)+abort'`
- `--preview-window` with size 0 is allowed. This is used to make fzf execute
  preview command in the background without displaying the result.
- Minor bug fixes and improvements

0.16.1
------
- Fixed `--height` option to properly fill the window with the background
  color
- Added `half-page-up` and `half-page-down` actions
- Added `-L` flag to the default find command

0.16.0
------
- *Added `--height HEIGHT[%]` option*
    - fzf can now display finder without occupying the full screen
- Preview window will truncate long lines by default. Line wrap can be enabled
  by `:wrap` flag in `--preview-window`.
- Latin script letters will be normalized before matching so that it's easier
  to match against accented letters. e.g. `sodanco` can match `Só Danço Samba`.
    - Normalization can be disabled via `--literal`
- Added `--filepath-word` to make word-wise movements/actions (`alt-b`,
  `alt-f`, `alt-bs`, `alt-d`) respect path separators

0.15.9
------
- Fixed rendering glitches introduced in 0.15.8
- The default escape delay is reduced to 50ms and is configurable via
  `$ESCDELAY`
- Scroll indicator at the top-right corner of the preview window is always
  displayed when there's overflow
- Can now be built with ncurses 6 or tcell to support extra features
    - *ncurses 6*
        - Supports more than 256 color pairs
        - Supports italics
    - *tcell*
        - 24-bit color support
    - See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/BUILD.md

0.15.8
------
- Updated ANSI processor to handle more VT-100 escape sequences
- Added `--no-bold` (and `--bold`) option
- Improved escape sequence processing for WSL
- Added support for `alt-[0-9]`, `f11`, and `f12` for `--bind` and `--expect`

0.15.7
------
- Fixed panic when color is disabled and header lines contain ANSI colors

0.15.6
------
- Windows binaries! (@kelleyma49)
- Fixed the bug where header lines are cleared when preview window is toggled
- Fixed not to display ^N and ^O on screen
- Fixed cursor keys (or any key sequence that starts with ESC) on WSL by
  making fzf wait for additional keystrokes after ESC for up to 100ms

0.15.5
------
- Setting foreground color will no longer set background color to black
    - e.g. `fzf --color fg:153`
- `--tiebreak=end` will consider relative position instead of absolute distance
- Updated `fzf#wrap` function to respect `g:fzf_colors`

0.15.4
------
- Added support for range expression in preview and execute action
    - e.g. `ls -l | fzf --preview="echo user={3} when={-4..-2}; cat {-1}" --header-lines=1`
    - `{q}` will be replaced to the single-quoted string of the current query
- Fixed to properly handle unicode whitespace characters
- Display scroll indicator in preview window
- Inverse search term will use exact matcher by default
    - This is a breaking change, but I believe it makes much more sense. It is
      almost impossible to predict which entries will be filtered out due to
      a fuzzy inverse term. You can still perform inverse-fuzzy-match by
      prepending `!'` to the term.

0.15.3
------
- Added support for more ANSI attributes: dim, underline, blink, and reverse
- Fixed race condition in `toggle-preview`

0.15.2
------
- Preview window is now scrollable
    - With mouse scroll or with bindable actions
        - `preview-up`
        - `preview-down`
        - `preview-page-up`
        - `preview-page-down`
- Updated ANSI processor to support high intensity colors and ignore
  some VT100-related escape sequences

0.15.1
------
- Fixed panic when the pattern occurs after 2^15-th column
- Fixed rendering delay when displaying extremely long lines

0.15.0
------
- Improved fuzzy search algorithm
    - Added `--algo=[v1|v2]` option so one can still choose the old algorithm
      which values the search performance over the quality of the result
- Advanced scoring criteria
- `--read0` to read input delimited by ASCII NUL character
- `--print0` to print output delimited by ASCII NUL character

0.13.5
------
- Memory and performance optimization
    - Up to 2x performance with half the amount of memory

0.13.4
------
- Performance optimization
    - Memory footprint for ascii string is reduced by 60%
    - 15 to 20% improvement of query performance
    - Up to 45% better performance of `--nth` with non-regex delimiters
- Fixed invalid handling of `hidden` property of `--preview-window`

0.13.3
------
- Fixed duplicate rendering of the last line in preview window

0.13.2
------
- Fixed race condition where preview window is not properly cleared

0.13.1
------
- Fixed UI issue with large `--preview` output with many ANSI codes

0.13.0
------
- Added preview feature
    - `--preview CMD`
    - `--preview-window POS[:SIZE][:hidden]`
- `{}` in execute action is now replaced to the single-quoted (instead of
  double-quoted) string of the current line
- Fixed to ignore control characters for bracketed paste mode

0.12.2
------

- 256-color capability detection does not require `256` in `$TERM`
- Added `print-query` action
- More named keys for binding; <kbd>F1</kbd> ~ <kbd>F10</kbd>,
  <kbd>ALT-/</kbd>, <kbd>ALT-space</kbd>, and <kbd>ALT-enter</kbd>
- Added `jump` and `jump-accept` actions that implement [EasyMotion][em]-like
  movement
  ![][jump]

0.12.1
------

- Ranking algorithm introduced in 0.12.0 is now universally applied
- Fixed invalid cache reference in exact mode
- Fixes and improvements in Vim plugin and shell extensions

0.12.0
------

- Enhanced ranking algorithm
- Minor bug fixes

0.11.4
------

- Added `--hscroll-off=COL` option (default: 10) (#513)
- Some fixes in Vim plugin and shell extensions

0.11.3
------

- Graceful exit on SIGTERM (#482)
- `$SHELL` instead of `sh` for `execute` action and `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` (#481)
- Changes in fuzzy completion API
    - [`_fzf_compgen_{path,dir}`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/commit/9617647)
    - [`_fzf_complete_COMMAND_post`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/commit/8206746)
      for post-processing

0.11.2
------

- `--tiebreak` now accepts comma-separated list of sort criteria
    - Each criterion should appear only once in the list
    - `index` is only allowed at the end of the list
    - `index` is implicitly appended to the list when not specified
    - Default is `length` (or equivalently `length,index`)
- `begin` criterion will ignore leading whitespaces when calculating the index
- Added `toggle-in` and `toggle-out` actions
    - Switch direction depending on `--reverse`-ness
    - `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="--bind tab:toggle-out,shift-tab:toggle-in"`
- Reduced the initial delay when `--tac` is not given
    - fzf defers the initial rendering of the screen up to 100ms if the input
      stream is ongoing to prevent unnecessary redraw during the initial
      phase. However, 100ms delay is quite noticeable and might give the
      impression that fzf is not snappy enough. This commit reduces the
      maximum delay down to 20ms when `--tac` is not specified, in which case
      the input list quickly fills the entire screen.

0.11.1
------

- Added `--tabstop=SPACES` option

0.11.0
------

- Added OR operator for extended-search mode
- Added `--execute-multi` action
- Fixed incorrect cursor position when unicode wide characters are used in
  `--prompt`
- Fixes and improvements in shell extensions

0.10.9
------

- Extended-search mode is now enabled by default
    - `--extended-exact` is deprecated and instead we have `--exact` for
      orthogonally controlling "exactness" of search
- Fixed not to display non-printable characters
- Added `double-click` for `--bind` option
- More robust handling of SIGWINCH

0.10.8
------

- Fixed panic when trying to set colors after colors are disabled (#370)

0.10.7
------

- Fixed unserialized interrupt handling during execute action which often
  caused invalid memory access and crash
- Changed `--tiebreak=length` (default) to use trimmed length when `--nth` is
  used

0.10.6
------

- Replaced `--header-file` with `--header` option
- `--header` and `--header-lines` can be used together
- Changed exit status
    - 0: Okay
    - 1: No match
    - 2: Error
    - 130: Interrupted
- 64-bit linux binary is statically-linked with ncurses to avoid
  compatibility issues.

0.10.5
------

- `'`-prefix to unquote the term in `--extended-exact` mode
- Backward scan when `--tiebreak=end` is set

0.10.4
------

- Fixed to remove ANSI code from output when `--with-nth` is set

0.10.3
------

- Fixed slow performance of `--with-nth` when used with `--delimiter`
    - Regular expression engine of Golang as of now is very slow, so the fixed
      version will treat the given delimiter pattern as a plain string instead
      of a regular expression unless it contains special characters and is
      a valid regular expression.
    - Simpler regular expression for delimiter for better performance

0.10.2
------

### Fixes and improvements

- Improvement in perceived response time of queries
    - Eager, efficient rune array conversion
- Graceful exit when failed to initialize ncurses (invalid $TERM)

  start with dash

0.10.1
------

### New features

- Added `--margin` option
- Added options for sticky header
    - `--header-file`
    - `--header-lines`
- Added `cancel` action which clears the input or closes the finder when the
  input is already empty
    - e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="--bind esc:cancel"`
- Added `delete-char/eof` action to differentiate `CTRL-D` and `DEL`

### Minor improvements/fixes

- Fixed to allow binding colon and comma keys
- Fixed ANSI processor to handle color regions spanning multiple lines

0.10.0
------

### New features

- More actions for `--bind`
    - `select-all`
    - `deselect-all`
    - `toggle-all`
    - `ignore`
- `execute(...)` action for running arbitrary command without leaving fzf
    - `fzf --bind "ctrl-m:execute(less {})"`
    - `fzf --bind "ctrl-t:execute(tmux new-window -d 'vim {}')"`
    - If the command contains parentheses, use any of the follows alternative
      notations to avoid parse errors
        - `execute[...]`
        - `execute~...~`
        - `execute!...!`
        - `execute@...@`
        - `execute#...#`
        - `execute$...$`
        - `execute%...%`
        - `execute^...^`
        - `execute&...&`
        - `execute*...*`
        - `execute;...;`
        - `execute/.../`
        - `execute|...|`
        - `execute:...`
            - This is the special form that frees you from parse errors as it
              does not expect the closing character
            - The catch is that it should be the last one in the
              comma-separated list
- Added support for optional search history
    - `--history HISTORY_FILE`
        - When used, `CTRL-N` and `CTRL-P` are automatically remapped to
          `next-history` and `previous-history`
    - `--history-size MAX_ENTRIES` (default: 1000)
- Cyclic scrolling can be enabled with `--cycle`
- Fixed the bug where the spinner was not spinning on idle input stream
    - e.g. `sleep 100 | fzf`

### Minor improvements/fixes

- Added synonyms for key names that can be specified for `--bind`,
  `--toggle-sort`, and `--expect`
- Fixed the color of multi-select marker on the current line
- Fixed to allow `^pattern$` in extended-search mode

- Fixed ANSI code offset calculation

0.9.11
------

### New features

     - Useful inside Neovim
     - e.g. `let $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS = $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS.' --inline-info'`

### Bug fixes

- Invalid mutation of input on case conversion (#209)
- Smart-case for each term in extended-search mode (#208)

0.9.9
-----

### New features

- Added `--tiebreak` option (#191)
- Added `--no-hscroll` option (#193)
- Visual indication of `--toggle-sort` (#194)

0.9.8
-----

- Fixed to terminate on RuneError (#185)

0.9.7
-----

### New features

- Added `--toggle-sort` option (#173)
    - `--toggle-sort=ctrl-r` is applied to `CTRL-R` shell extension

### Bug fixes

- Fixed to print empty line if `--expect` is set and fzf is completed by
  `--select-1` or `--exit-0` (#172)
- Fixed to allow comma character as an argument to `--expect` option

0.9.6
-----

### New features

#### Added `--expect` option (#163)

If you provide a comma-separated list of keys with `--expect` option, fzf will
allow you to select the match and complete the finder when any of the keys is
pressed. Additionally, fzf will print the name of the key pressed as the first
line of the output so that your script can decide what to do next based on the
information.

```sh
fzf --expect=ctrl-v,ctrl-t,alt-s,f1,f2,~,@
```

The updated vim plugin uses this option to implement
[ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)-compatible key bindings.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed to ignore ANSI escape code `\e[K` (#162)

0.9.5
-----

### New features

#### Added `--ansi` option (#150)

If you give `--ansi` option to fzf, fzf will interpret ANSI color codes from
the input, display the item with the ANSI colors (true colors are not
supported), and strips the codes from the output. This option is off by
default as it entails some overhead.

### Improvements

#### Reduced initial memory footprint (#151)

By removing unnecessary copy of pointers, fzf will use significantly smaller
amount of memory when it's started. The difference is hugely noticeable when
the input is extremely large. (e.g. `locate / | fzf`)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed panic on `--no-sort --filter ''` (#149)

0.9.4
-----

### New features

#### Added `--tac` option to reverse the order of the input.

One might argue that this option is unnecessary since we can already put `tac`
or `tail -r` in the command pipeline to achieve the same result. However, the
advantage of `--tac` is that it does not block until the input is complete.

### *Backward incompatible changes*

#### Changed behavior on `--no-sort`

`--no-sort` option will no longer reverse the display order within finder. You
may want to use the new `--tac` option with `--no-sort`.

```
history | fzf +s --tac
```

### Improvements

#### `--filter` will not block when sort is disabled

When fzf works in filtering mode (`--filter`) and sort is disabled
(`--no-sort`), there's no need to block until input is complete. The new
version of fzf will print the matches on-the-fly when the following condition
is met:

    --filter TERM --no-sort [--no-tac --no-sync]

or simply:

    -f TERM +s

This change removes unnecessary delay in the use cases like the following:

    fzf -f xxx +s | head -5

However, in this case, fzf processes the lines sequentially, so it cannot
utilize multiple cores, and fzf will run slightly slower than the previous
mode of execution where filtering is done in parallel after the entire input
is loaded. If the user is concerned about this performance problem, one can
add `--sync` option to re-enable buffering.

0.9.3
-----

### New features
- Added `--sync` option for multi-staged filtering

### Improvements
- `--select-1` and `--exit-0` will start finder immediately when the condition
  cannot be met
