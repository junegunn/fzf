.TH fzf-tmux 1 "Dec 2021" "fzf 0.29.0" "fzf-tmux - open fzf in tmux split pane"

.SH NAME
fzf-tmux - open fzf in tmux split pane

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fzf-tmux [LAYOUT OPTIONS] [--] [FZF OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
fzf-tmux is a wrapper script for fzf that opens fzf in a tmux split pane or in
a tmux popup window. It is designed to work just like fzf except that it does
not take up the whole screen. You can safely use fzf-tmux instead of fzf in
your scripts as the extra options will be silently ignored if you're not on
tmux.
