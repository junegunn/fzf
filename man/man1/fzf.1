With \fBexecute(...)\fR action, you can execute arbitrary commands without
leaving fzf. For example, you can turn fzf into a simple file browser by
binding \fBenter\fR key to \fBless\fR command like follows.

.RS
\fBfzf --bind "enter:execute(less {})"\fR
.RE

\fB{}\fR is the placeholder for the double-quoted string of the current line.
If the command contains parentheses, you can use any of the following
alternative notations to avoid parse errors.

    \fBexecute[...]\fR
    \fBexecute~...~\fR
    \fBexecute!...!\fR
    \fBexecute@...@\fR
    \fBexecute#...#\fR
    \fBexecute$...$\fR
    \fBexecute%...%\fR
    \fBexecute^...^\fR
    \fBexecute&...&\fR
    \fBexecute*...*\fR
    \fBexecute;...;\fR
    \fBexecute/.../\fR
    \fBexecute|...|\fR
    \fBexecute:...\fR
.RS
This is the special form that frees you from parse errors as it does not expect
the closing character. The catch is that it should be the last one in the
comma-separated list.
.RE

\fBexecute-multi(...)\fR is an alternative action that executes the command
with the selected entries when multi-select is enabled (\fB--multi\fR). With
this action, \fB{}\fR is replaced with the double-quoted strings of the
selected entries separated by spaces.

.RE
.TP
.BI "--history=" "HISTORY_FILE"
Load search history from the specified file and update the file on completion.
When enabled, \fBCTRL-N\fR and \fBCTRL-P\fR are automatically remapped to
\fBnext-history\fR and \fBprevious-history\fR.
.TP
.BI "--history-size=" "N"
Maximum number of entries in the history file (default: 1000). The file is
automatically truncated when the number of the lines exceeds the value.
.TP
.BI "--header=" "STR"
The given string will be printed as the sticky header. The lines are displayed
in the given order from top to bottom regardless of \fB--reverse\fR option, and
are not affected by \fB--with-nth\fR. ANSI color codes are processed even when
\fB--ansi\fR is not set.
.TP
.BI "--header-lines=" "N"
The first N lines of the input are treated as the sticky header. When
\fB--with-nth\fR is set, the lines are transformed just like the other
lines that follow.
.SS Scripting
.TP
.BI "-q, --query=" "STR"
Start the finder with the given query
.TP
.B "-1, --select-1"
Automatically select the only match
.TP
.B "-0, --exit-0"
Exit immediately when there's no match
.TP
.BI "-f, --filter=" "STR"
Filter mode. Do not start interactive finder. When used with \fB--no-sort\fR,
fzf becomes a fuzzy-version of grep.
.TP
.B "--print-query"
Print query as the first line
.TP
.BI "--expect=" "KEY[,..]"
Comma-separated list of keys that can be used to complete fzf in addition to
the default enter key. When this option is set, fzf will print the name of the
key pressed as the first line of its output (or as the second line if
\fB--print-query\fR is also used). The line will be empty if fzf is completed
with the default enter key.
.RS
e.g. \fBfzf --expect=ctrl-v,ctrl-t,alt-s,f1,f2,~,@\fR
.RE
.TP
.B "--sync"
Synchronous search for multi-staged filtering. If specified, fzf will launch
ncurses finder only after the input stream is complete.
.RS
e.g. \fBfzf --multi | fzf --sync\fR
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND
Default command to use when input is tty
.TP
.B FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
Default options. e.g. \fBexport FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="--extended --cycle"\fR

.SH EXIT STATUS
.BR 0 "      Normal exit"
.br
.BR 1 "      No match"
.br
.BR 2 "      Error"
.br
.BR 130 "    Interrupted with \fBCTRL-C\fR or \fBESC\fR"

.SH FIELD INDEX EXPRESSION

A field index expression can be a non-zero integer or a range expression
([BEGIN]..[END]). \fB--nth\fR and \fB--with-nth\fR take a comma-separated list
of field index expressions.

.SS Examples
.BR 1 "      The 1st field"
.br
.BR 2 "      The 2nd field"
.br
.BR -1 "     The last field"
.br
.BR -2 "     The 2nd to last field"
.br
.BR 3..5 "   From the 3rd field to the 5th field"
.br
.BR 2.. "    From the 2nd field to the last field"
.br
.BR ..-3 "   From the 1st field to the 3rd to the last field"
.br
.BR .. "     All the fields"
.br

.SH EXTENDED SEARCH MODE

Unless specified otherwise, fzf will start in "extended-search mode". In this
mode, you can specify multiple patterns delimited by spaces, such as: \fB'wild
^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !rmx\fR

.SS Exact-match (quoted)
A term that is prefixed by a single-quote character (\fB'\fR) is interpreted as
an "exact-match" (or "non-fuzzy") term. fzf will search for the exact
occurrences of the string.

.SS Anchored-match
A term can be prefixed by \fB^\fR, or suffixed by \fB$\fR to become an
anchored-match term. Then fzf will search for the items that start with or end
with the given string. An anchored-match term is also an exact-match term.

.SS Negation
If a term is prefixed by \fB!\fR, fzf will exclude the items that satisfy the
term from the result.

.SS Exact-match by default
If you don't prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to "quote" (prefixing with
\fB'\fR) every word, start fzf with \fB-e\fR or \fB--exact\fR option. Note that
when \fB--exact\fR is set, \fB'\fR-prefix "unquotes" the term.

.SS OR operator
A single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following
query matches entries that start with \fBcore\fR and end with either \fBgo\fR,
\fBrb\fR, or \fBpy\fR.

e.g. \fB^core go$ | rb$ | py$\fR
