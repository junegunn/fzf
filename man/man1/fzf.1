.SH NAME
fzf - a command-line fuzzy finder

.SH SYNOPSIS
fzf [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS Search mode
.TP
.B "-x, --extended"
Extended-search mode. Since 0.10.9, this is enabled by default. You can disable
it with \fB+x\fR or \fB--no-extended\fR.
.TP
.B "-e, --exact"

.TP
.B "-i"
Case-insensitive match (default: smart-case match)
.TP
.B "+i"
Case-sensitive match
.TP
.B "--literal"
Do not normalize latin script letters for matching.
.TP
.BI "--algo=" TYPE
Fuzzy matching algorithm (default: v2)

Transform the presentation of each line using field index expressions
.TP
.BI "-d, --delimiter=" "STR"
Field delimiter regex for \fB--nth\fR and \fB--with-nth\fR (default: AWK-style)
.TP
.BI "--phony"
Do not perform search. With this option, fzf becomes a simple selector
interface rather than a "fuzzy finder".
.SS Search result
.TP
.B "+s, --no-sort"
Do not sort the result
.TP
.B "--tac"
Reverse the order of the input

.RS
e.g.
     \fBhistory | fzf --tac --no-sort\fR
.RE
.TP
.BI "--tiebreak=" "CRI[,..]"
Comma-separated list of sort criteria to apply when the scores are tied.
.br

.br
.BR length "  Prefers line with shorter length"
.br
.BR begin "   Prefers line with matched substring closer to the beginning"
.br
.BR end "     Prefers line with matched substring closer to the end"
.br
.BR index "   Prefers line that appeared earlier in the input stream"
.br

.br
- Each criterion should appear only once in the list
.br
- \fBindex\fR is only allowed at the end of the list
.br
- \fBindex\fR is implicitly appended to the list when not specified
.br
- Default is \fBlength\fR (or equivalently \fBlength\fR,index)

.RE
.TP
.B "--no-bold"
Do not use bold text
.TP
.B "--black"
Use black background
.SS History
.TP
.BI "--history=" "HISTORY_FILE"
Load search history from the specified file and update the file on completion.
When enabled, \fBCTRL-N\fR and \fBCTRL-P\fR are automatically remapped to
\fBnext-history\fR and \fBprevious-history\fR.
.TP
.BI "--history-size=" "N"
Maximum number of entries in the history file (default: 1000). The file is
automatically truncated when the number of the lines exceeds the value.
.SS Preview
.TP
.BI "--preview=" "COMMAND"
Execute the given command for the current line and display the result on the
preview window. \fB{}\fR in the command is the placeholder that is replaced to
the single-quoted string of the current line. To transform the replacement
string, specify field index expressions between the braces (See \fBFIELD INDEX
EXPRESSION\fR for the details).

.RS
e.g.
     \fBfzf --preview='head -$LINES {}'
     ls -l | fzf --preview="echo user={3} when={-4..-2}; cat {-1}" --header-lines=1\fR

fzf exports \fB$FZF_PREVIEW_LINES\fR and \fB$FZF_PREVIEW_COLUMNS\fR so that
they represent the exact size of the preview window. (It also overrides
\fB$LINES\fR and \fB$COLUMNS\fR with the same values but they can be reset
by the default shell, so prefer to refer to the ones with \fBFZF_PREVIEW_\fR
prefix.)

A placeholder expression starting with \fB+\fR flag will be replaced to the
space-separated list of the selected lines (or the current line if no selection
was made) individually quoted.

e.g.
     \fBfzf --multi --preview='head -10 {+}'
     git log --oneline | fzf --multi --preview 'git show {+1}'\fR

When using a field index expression, leading and trailing whitespace is stripped
from the replacement string. To preserve the whitespace, use the \fBs\fR flag.

Also, \fB{q}\fR is replaced to the current query string, and \fB{n}\fR is
replaced to zero-based ordinal index of the line. Use \fB{+n}\fR if you want
all index numbers when multiple lines are selected.

A placeholder expression with \fBf\fR flag is replaced to the path of
a temporary file that holds the evaluated list. This is useful when you
multi-select a large number of items and the length of the evaluated string may
exceed \fBARG_MAX\fR.

e.g.
     \fB# Press CTRL-A to select 100K items and see the sum of all the numbers.
     # This won't work properly without 'f' flag due to ARG_MAX limit.
     seq 100000 | fzf --multi --bind ctrl-a:select-all \\
                      --preview "awk '{sum+=\$1} END {print sum}' {+f}"\fR

Note that you can escape a placeholder pattern by prepending a backslash.

Preview window will be updated even when there is no match for the current
query if any of the placeholder expressions evaluates to a non-empty string.
.RE
.TP
.BI "--preview-window=" "[POSITION][:SIZE[%]][:noborder][:wrap][:hidden]"
Determines the layout of the preview window. If the argument contains
\fB:hidden\fR, the preview window will be hidden by default until
\fBtoggle-preview\fR action is triggered. Long lines are truncated by default.
Line wrap can be enabled with \fB:wrap\fR flag.

If size is given as 0, preview window will not be visible, but fzf will still
execute the command in the background.

.RE
.SS Scripting
.TP
.BI "-q, --query=" "STR"
Start the finder with the given query
.TP
.B "-1, --select-1"
Automatically select the only match
.TP
.B "-0, --exit-0"
Exit immediately when there's no match
.TP
.BI "-f, --filter=" "STR"
Filter mode. Do not start interactive finder. When used with \fB--no-sort\fR,
fzf becomes a fuzzy-version of grep.
.TP
.B "--print-query"
Print query as the first line
.TP
.BI "--expect=" "KEY[,..]"
Comma-separated list of keys that can be used to complete fzf in addition to
the default enter key. When this option is set, fzf will print the name of the
key pressed as the first line of its output (or as the second line if
\fB--print-query\fR is also used). The line will be empty if fzf is completed
with the default enter key. If \fB--expect\fR option is specified multiple
times, fzf will expect the union of the keys. \fB--no-expect\fR will clear the
list.

.RS
e.g.
     \fBfzf --expect=ctrl-v,ctrl-t,alt-s --expect=f1,f2,~,@\fR
.RE
.TP
.B "--read0"
Read input delimited by ASCII NUL characters instead of newline characters
.TP
.B "--print0"
Print output delimited by ASCII NUL characters instead of newline characters
.TP
.B "--no-clear"
Do not clear finder interface on exit. If fzf was started in full screen mode,
it will not switch back to the original screen, so you'll have to manually run
\fBtput rmcup\fR to return. This option can be used to avoid flickering of the
screen when your application needs to start fzf multiple times in order.
.TP
.B "--sync"
Synchronous search for multi-staged filtering. If specified, fzf will launch
ncurses finder only after the input stream is complete.

.RS
e.g. \fBfzf --multi | fzf --sync\fR
.RE
.TP
.B "--version"
Display version information and exit

.TP
Note that most options have the opposite versions with \fB--no-\fR prefix.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
.B FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND
Default command to use when input is tty. On *nix systems, fzf runs the command
with \fBsh -c\fR, so make sure that it's POSIX-compliant.
.TP
.B FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
Default options. e.g. \fBexport FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="--extended --cycle"\fR

.SH EXIT STATUS
.BR 0 "      Normal exit"
.br
.BR 1 "      No match"
.br
.BR 2 "      Error"
.br
.BR 130 "    Interrupted with \fBCTRL-C\fR or \fBESC\fR"

.SH FIELD INDEX EXPRESSION

A field index expression can be a non-zero integer or a range expression
([BEGIN]..[END]). \fB--nth\fR and \fB--with-nth\fR take a comma-separated list
of field index expressions.

.SS Examples
.BR 1 "      The 1st field"
.br
.BR 2 "      The 2nd field"
.br
.BR -1 "     The last field"
.br
.BR -2 "     The 2nd to last field"
.br
.BR 3..5 "   From the 3rd field to the 5th field"
.br
.BR 2.. "    From the 2nd field to the last field"
.br
.BR ..-3 "   From the 1st field to the 3rd to the last field"
.br
.BR .. "     All the fields"
.br

.SH EXTENDED SEARCH MODE

Unless specified otherwise, fzf will start in "extended-search mode". In this
mode, you can specify multiple patterns delimited by spaces, such as: \fB'wild
^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !rmx\fR

You can prepend a backslash to a space (\fB\\ \fR) to match a literal space
character.

.SS Exact-match (quoted)
A term that is prefixed by a single-quote character (\fB'\fR) is interpreted as
an "exact-match" (or "non-fuzzy") term. fzf will search for the exact
occurrences of the string.

.SS Anchored-match
A term can be prefixed by \fB^\fR, or suffixed by \fB$\fR to become an
anchored-match term. Then fzf will search for the lines that start with or end
with the given string. An anchored-match term is also an exact-match term.

.SS Negation
If a term is prefixed by \fB!\fR, fzf will exclude the lines that satisfy the
term from the result. In this case, fzf performs exact match by default.

.SS Exact-match by default
If you don't prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to "quote" (prefixing with
\fB'\fR) every word, start fzf with \fB-e\fR or \fB--exact\fR option. Note that
when \fB--exact\fR is set, \fB'\fR-prefix "unquotes" the term.

.SS OR operator
A single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following
query matches entries that start with \fBcore\fR and end with either \fBgo\fR,
\fBrb\fR, or \fBpy\fR.

e.g. \fB^core go$ | rb$ | py$\fR

.SH KEY/EVENT BINDINGS
\fB--bind\fR option allows you to bind \fBa key\fR or \fBan event\fR to one or
more \fBactions\fR. You can use it to customize key bindings or implement
dynamic behaviors.

\fB--bind\fR takes a comma-separated list of binding expressions. Each binding
expression is \fBKEY:ACTION\fR or \fBEVENT:ACTION\fR.

e.g.
     \fBfzf --bind=ctrl-j:accept,ctrl-k:kill-line\fR

.SS ACTION COMPOSITION

Multiple actions can be chained using \fB+\fR separator.

e.g.
     \fBfzf --bind 'ctrl-a:select-all+accept'\fR

.SS COMMAND EXECUTION

With \fBexecute(...)\fR action, you can execute arbitrary commands without
leaving fzf. For example, you can turn fzf into a simple file browser by
binding \fBenter\fR key to \fBless\fR command like follows.

    \fBfzf --bind "enter:execute(less {})"\fR

You can use the same placeholder expressions as in \fB--preview\fR.

If the command contains parentheses, fzf may fail to parse the expression. In
that case, you can use any of the following alternative notations to avoid
parse errors.

    \fBexecute[...]\fR
    \fBexecute~...~\fR
    \fBexecute!...!\fR
    \fBexecute@...@\fR
    \fBexecute#...#\fR
    \fBexecute$...$\fR
    \fBexecute%...%\fR
    \fBexecute^...^\fR
    \fBexecute&...&\fR
    \fBexecute*...*\fR
    \fBexecute;...;\fR
    \fBexecute/.../\fR
    \fBexecute|...|\fR
    \fBexecute:...\fR
.RS
The last one is the special form that frees you from parse errors as it does
not expect the closing character. The catch is that it should be the last one
in the comma-separated list of key-action pairs.
.RE

fzf switches to the alternate screen when executing a command. However, if the
command is expected to complete quickly, and you are not interested in its
output, you might want to use \fBexecute-silent\fR instead, which silently
executes the command without the switching. Note that fzf will not be
responsive until the command is complete. For asynchronous execution, start
your command as a background process (i.e. appending \fB&\fR).

.SS RELOAD INPUT

\fBreload(...)\fR action is used to dynamically update the input list
without restarting fzf. It takes the same command template with placeholder
expressions as \fBexecute(...)\fR.

See \fIhttps://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1750\fR for more info.

e.g.
     \fB# Update the list of processes by pressing CTRL-R
     ps -ef | fzf --bind 'ctrl-r:reload(ps -ef)' --header 'Press CTRL-R to reload' \\
                  --header-lines=1 --layout=reverse

     # Integration with ripgrep
     RG_PREFIX="rg --column --line-number --no-heading --color=always --smart-case "
     INITIAL_QUERY="foobar"
     FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND="$RG_PREFIX '$INITIAL_QUERY'" \\
       fzf --bind "change:reload:$RG_PREFIX {q} || true" \\
           --ansi --phony --query "$INITIAL_QUERY"\fR
